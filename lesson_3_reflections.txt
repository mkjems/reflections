When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	If you would like to share the repo. Allowing others or other machines to to
	make changes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If git allways pulled changes without you controlling it then you would not
	know the state of your code.
