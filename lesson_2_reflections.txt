What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates the hidden .git directory that stores all the git information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different because only the files you choose will enter
	it. This means that you can filter stuff away that you do not want committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By running git diff --staged you can see the changes you are about to commit

	by running git diff you can see the diff between the staging area and the
	working directory

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	If you want to try out some more complicated changes that require more than
	one commit.

	If you are multiple people working on a project you could each work on your
	own branch and then make pull requests to master when each task is done.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	I can give you an overview of the activity in multiple branches.
	It can show when one branch was created of another.
