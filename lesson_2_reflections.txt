What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates the hidden .git directory that stores all the git information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different because only the files you choose will enter
	it. This means that you can filter stuff away that you do not want committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By running git diff --staged you can see the changes you are about to commit

	by running git diff you can see the diff between the staging area and the
	working directory
